## Project Direction - "God Mode" Office Manager

### Simplified Signup Flow (Reference from Rico's friend)
- **Signup fields:** Full Name, Company/Business Name, Email, Password
- **Settings page:** Account info, Organization name + plan, Google Calendar integration, Sign Out
- **Behind scenes:** Auto-create organization on signup

### Key Insight
No technical setup visible to users (no GHL, no API keys, no CRM configuration). The system handles everything automatically - this is "god mode" automation.

### Action Items
- Consider simplifying the Office Manager signup flow to match this pattern
- Auto-organization creation for multi-tenant support
- Hide technical configurations from regular users
